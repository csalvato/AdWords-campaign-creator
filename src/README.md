# AdWords Campaign Creator

A series of Ruby classes that are used with a procedural script (campaign-creator-(reboot).rb) to create massive amounts of hyper-local AdWords campaigns, ad groups and ads based on seed keywords.

These classes define most of the functions of every AdWords object, providing flexibility to automate the creation of various complicated campaign types.
